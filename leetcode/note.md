When given a question, try drawing a picture simulating your thought process.
If you get lucky, you will find the pattern which allows you to write an algorithm straight away.

If you think the problem requires storing previous data, consider dp or hashmap
If problem has various states, consider dp

If you have the algorithm in your head but can't figure out the edge case, step back and think about the whole picture.
